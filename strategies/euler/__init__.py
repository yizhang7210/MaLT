""" Euler is a collection of individual strategies that attempt to make
    predictions based on daily candles. They use the open, close, high and
    low (both bid and ask) prices of the previous day as features and use
    machine learning to predict the profitable price change of the next day.

    Both classification and regression methods were used. More sophisticated
    variations of the strategy also exist, for example using stop loss or
    take profit orders.
