""" Gauss is a collection of individual strategies that attempt to make
    predictions based on daily candles. They use the midpoint candles of the
    previous five (5) days as features and use machine learning to predict
    the profitable price change of the next day.

    Both classification and regression methods were used. More sophisticated
    variations of the strategy also exist, for example using stop loss or
    take profit orders.
